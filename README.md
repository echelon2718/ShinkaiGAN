## Introduction

ShinkaiGAN is inspired by the stunning visual style of Makoto Shinkai, known for his work in anime films such as "Your Name" and "Weathering With You". The goal of this project is to create a model that can take a simple sketch and transform it into a fully colored anime scene that mimics Shinkai's unique artistic style.

## Model Architecture

The core of ShinkaiGAN is based on the Hybrid Perception Block U-Net architecture. This architecture combines the strengths of U-Net with additional perception blocks that help the model understand and generate detailed and aesthetically pleasing outputs.

### Hybrid Perception Block U-Net

- **U-Net Backbone:** Provides a robust encoder-decoder structure that captures multi-scale features.
- **Perception Blocks:** Enhances the model's ability to perceive and generate fine details, which is crucial for replicating the intricate styles of Makoto Shinkai's artwork.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a custom dataset that includes:
- High-resolution anime scenes from various Makoto Shinkai movies.
- Corresponding sketch images manually created or extracted using edge detection algorithms.

## Training

The training process involves the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Preparing the sketch and anime scene pairs for training.
2. **Model Training:** Training the Hybrid Perception Block U-Net using the prepared dataset.
3. **Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tuning the model to enhance output quality and style accuracy.

### Training Parameters

- **Batch Size:** 16
- **Learning Rate:** 0.0002
- **Epochs:** 100
- **Loss Function:** Combination of L1 loss and perceptual loss.

## Usage

To use ShinkaiGAN, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ShinkaiGAN.git
    cd ShinkaiGAN
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run Inference:**

    ```python
    from model import ShinkaiGAN
    from utils import load_image, save_image

    # Load your sketch image
    sketch_image = load_image('path_to_your_sketch_image.png')

    # Initialize the model
    model = ShinkaiGAN()

    # Generate the anime scene
    anime_scene = model.transform(sketch_image)

    # Save the result
    save_image(anime_scene, 'output_path.png')
    ```

## Results

Here are some examples of sketch-to-anime transformations using ShinkaiGAN:

| Sketch | Anime Scene |
|--------|--------------|
| ![Sketch](examples/sketch1.png) | ![Anime Scene](examples/anime1.png) |
| ![Sketch](examples/sketch2.png) | ![Anime Scene](examples/anime2.png) |
